            <h1>About the project</h1>
            <p>This project's goal is to craft a website that is easily navigable by individuals with disabilities on
                both desktop and mobile devices. By following universal design principles and integrating Web Content
                Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ARIA labels, to ensure accessibility for users with visual,
                auditory, cognitive, and motor disabilities.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The primary objective is to create an inclusive online
                platform that facilitates equal access to digital content for all.</p>

            <h2>The Team and My Role</h2>
            <p>This was a individual assignment, I acted as the researcher, website developer, UX designer and UI
                designer.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>As the only designer on this project, I managed both strategic and visual design. I used a flexible UX design thinking process, ensuring that every decision was based on by user research and feedback.</p>

                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>Based on the user research I set up one persona. The purpose of the web design was based on being accessible for individuals with disabilities. Emma became deaf after an accident, and have experienced difficulties with the lack of accessibility on hotel and travel websites. She has a lovely family, but she wants to feel included on their vacation and contain her independence aswell.</p>

                    <p>The design is inclusive, catering to the needs of individuals with various disabilities. Emma mostly affected the design and features regarding the video and audio elements, adding captions to everything with sound. I tried reflecting back to Emma thoughtout the design process.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframe</h2>
                    <p>I usually start every design process with low fidelity sketches, and can quickly iterate through design choices. Further on I made a wireframe to display better the design I wanted as the final result. I had to make some changes to color contrasts, placement of buttons and think about information overload.</p>

                    <p>Every element is tried to replicate an actual hotel page layout, but an improved version. The layout is clean and efficient, as a criteria was to make the design accessible for screen readers. The wireframes was a big help when actually coding the website, as a wireframe is easier to change than experimenting with code.</p>

                    <h2>UI Design</h2>
                    <p>I went for a light and clean visual style. The inspiration behind was to make the design look luxurious, but also effective to navigate. It is minimalistic with minimum clutter. For efficiency there is added accesskeys and "skip to main content", for faster keyboard use. Error prevention is added through mandatory elements in the contact form, and a confirmation message when sending the from, asking to confirm the submission.</p>

                    <p>The web site is responsive and work for phone, tablet and laptop. The thing that I am most proud of the overall design, and its consistency. I feel like the visual design, as well as the non-visual accessibility code can help achieve through higher satisfaction among users, and better reputation for businesses.</p>

            <h2>What have I learned from this project</h2>
            <p>I learned alot from this project through working and having to make most of the decitions and design choices my self. But my two biggest struggles was the research, not having individuals with a disability to interview or to ask for feedback on the project. Furtermore having to work alone could be a challange sometimes, having to take all the desitions myself, without having someone to share thoughts with.</p>

            <p>I overcame them by doing user research, looking through academic papers and online articles. With the working alone, I asked other students and teacher to look and give feedback with the criteria we had in hand.</p>

            <p>For a future project I wish to use more research and be able to test my design for the people intended to use it for a more real feedback. I feel like I could have implemented more of a </p>
