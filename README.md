# What the project does
The website presents information about climate change and its effects on the environment and humanity, as well as the actions that individuals and governments can take to mitigate its impact. 

The scrollytelling format allows users to navigate through the content in an engaging and interactive way, as they scroll down the page to reveal new sections of information. The website also features interactive elements such as animations and facts to help illustrate the concepts being presented.

## Target audience
The target audience for the website is adults between the ages of 35-45 who have a general awareness of sustainability issues but may not be familiar with the details. The website is designed to be accessible to users who are technologically sufficient to use the internet, personal computers, and smartphones without encountering significant difficulties.

Overall, the website seeks to **raise awareness** about Goal 13 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which focuses on combating climate change and its impacts. By presenting information in an engaging and visually compelling format, the website aims to encourage users to take action and make a positive difference in the fight against climate change.

# Why the project is useful
The project is a valuable contribution to raising awareness about one of the most pressing global issues of our time. Climate change is affecting every aspect of our lives, from the food we eat to the air we breathe, and it is crucial that we take action to reduce its effects. This project aims to inform and educate people about the importance of climate action, and inspire them to take meaningful steps towards a more sustainable future. By promoting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the project also aligns with the global effort to achieve a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable world.

# How users can get started with the project
Getting started with the "United Nations Goal 13: Climate Action" project is easy and straightforward. The first step is to fork the repository, which means creating a copy of the project on your own GitHub account. Once you have forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine, and start exploring the code and files.

The project uses amongst other things HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so it is **recommended** that you have a basic understanding of these technologies before diving in.

## Instructions[^1]:
1. Go to the GitHub repository that you want to fork.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.
3. Select the account where you want to fork the repository. If you have multiple accounts, make sure you select the correct one.
4. Wait for GitHub to create a fork of the repository. This may take a few seconds to complete.

### Furthermore
The objective of this project is to design a webpage using only CSS **without** using any additional JavaScript code. This means that all the dynamic and interactive features of the webpage should be created solely using CSS styling and animations. This can be a challenging task, but it allows for a more lightweight and efficient webpage that loads faster and has better performance. It also provides an opportunity to showcase advanced CSS skills and techniques. With careful planning and creativity, it is possible to create a visually appealing and engaging webpage using only CSS.

# Where users can get help with your project

# Which technology is used
The project uses a range of web technologies to create an interactive and engaging website. The project is built with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), SCSS (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology and CSS variables. HTML is used to create the structure and content of the website, while CSS and SCSS are used to style and layout the page elements. JavaScript is used to add dynamic functionality to the website, such as smooth scrolling and interactive animations. BEM methodology is used to organize the CSS code and make it more modular and reusable. Finally, CSS variables are used to define reusable values for colors, fonts, and other design elements.
