            <h1>About the project</h1>
            <p>This project's goal is to craft a website that is easily navigable by individuals with disabilities on
                both desktop and mobile devices. By following universal design principles and integrating Web Content
                Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ARIA labels, to ensure accessibility for users with visual,
                auditory, cognitive, and motor disabilities.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The primary objective is to create an inclusive online
                platform that facilitates equal access to digital content for all.</p>

            <h2>The Team and My Role</h2>
            <p>This was a individual assignment, I acted as the researcher, website developer, UX designer and UI
                designer.</p>

            <p>As the only designer on this project, I managed both strategic and visual design. I used a flexible UX
                design thinking process, ensuring that every decision was based on by user research and feedback.</p>

                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>Based on the user research I set up one persona. The purpose of the web design was based on being
                        accessible for individuals with disabilities. Emma became deaf after an accident, and have
                        experienced difficulties with the lack of accessibility on hotel and travel websites. She has a
                        lovely family, but she wants to feel included on their vacation and contain her independence
                        aswell.</p>

                    <p>The design is inclusive, catering to the needs of individuals with various disabilities. Emma
                        mostly affected the design and features regarding the video and audio elements, adding captions
                        to everything with sound. I tried reflecting back to Emma thoughtout the design process.</p>

                    <h2>UI Design</h2>
                    <p>I went for a light and clean visual style. The inspiration behind was to make the design look
                        luxurious,
                        but also effective to navigate. It is minimalistic with minimum clutter. For efficiency there is
                        added
                        accesskeys and "skip to main content", for faster keyboard use. Error prevention is added
                        through
                        mandatory elements in the contact form, and a confirmation message when sending the from, asking
                        to
                        confirm the submission.</p>

                    <p>The web site is responsive and work for phone, tablet and laptop. The thing that I am most proud
                        of the
                        overall design, and its consistency. I feel like the visual design, as well as the non-visual
                        accessibility code can help achieve through higher satisfaction among users, and better
                        reputation for
                        businesses.</p>

            <p>I learned alot from this project through working and having to make most of the decitions and design
                choices my self. But my two biggest struggles was the research, not having individuals with a disability
                to interview or to ask for feedback on the project. Furtermore having to work alone could be a challange
                sometimes, having to take all the desitions myself, without having someone to share thoughts with.</p>

            <p>I overcame them by doing user research, looking through academic papers and online articles. With the
                working alone, I asked other students and teacher to look and give feedback with the criteria we had in
                hand.</p>

            <p>For a future project I wish to use more research and be able to test my design for the people intended to
                use it for a more real feedback. I feel like I could have implemented more of a </p>
