            <h1 class="short-underline">Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>As we age, it's important to maintain independence and live at home as long as possible. A key factor for a good quality of life is the ability to get out and meet others, which requires accessible transportation.</p>

            <ul>
               <q>What new solutions can contribute to more age-friendly transportation in Gjøvik?</q>
</ul>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal is to support seniors in living at home as long as possible by improving transportation options.</p>

            <h2>The Team and My Role</h2>
            <p>Our team consisted of two graphic designers and two interaction designers. My main role was to contribute valuable insights from an interaction design perspective, work with Figma, and serve as the communicator.</p>

            <h2 class="title short-underline">The Design Process</h2>

            <p>We conducted several interviews with elderly and a transportation company, along with research on existing solutions and concepts both in Norway and abroad. We also gathered feedback and conducted user testing with fellow students and guerrilla testing to refine our approach.</p>

            <h4>The research methods:</h4>

                <h2>Interview</h2>

                <p>We have conducted interviews with elderly individuals and engaged in discussions with transportation services in Gjøvik to understand their transport challenges.</p>

                <img src="../assets/images/IDG2000/IDG2000-interview.jpg" alt="">
                <div>

                    <p>Elderly users are generally satisfied with the on-demand transportation service but experience issues with waiting times, particularly during delays. For example, waiting in the cold for up to 30 minutes without information on when the taxi will arrive is a significant concern.</p>

                    <p>Local taxi companies report difficulties in meeting demand and need a solution that increases the number of trips without increasing the number of vehicles, which is both economically and resource-wise challenging. </p>

                        <p>Our app is designed for Kari, a 74-year-old who wants to make shopping, running errands, and joining social activities easier. We created the app to help Kari manage these tasks more conveniently and stay active in her city’s social life. Our goal is to make it simple and accessible for her.</p>

                <p>At the end of the semester, we presented our work to the client and received feedback on the final product. Even after completing the project, it's exciting to see that there are always different ways to improve.</p>
